#pragma region Fix incorrect last transparent batch invalidation

/** This patches the part of ImageBase::begin_quad_batch that invalidates the last transparent batch
 *  of the last queued transparent image. This in order to avoid that following renders on that image
 *  will reuse that batch, leading to duplicate batches in the queue, and out of order rendering.
 *
 *  This is done by taking the image of the previous batch, and invalidating (setting to nullptr)
 *  the _lastTransparentRenderBatch field.
 *
 *  However this does not account for the case in which the previous image is the same as
 *  the currently queued one, leading to the current image's last render batch being incorrectly invalidated.
 *
 *  This temporarily breaks batching for this image, as now every render will be treated as it's own separate batch;
 *  even if the previous one matches the current shader and blend mode (this fixes itself when a different image is rendered).
 *
 *  Additionally it causes the creation of unnecessary render batches, which persist until the image is fully unloaded,
 *  leading to a waste of memory.
 *
 *  To fix this we simply add an additional check to see if the previous image is not the current image, before
 *  invalidating the last batch.

/** This patches the part of ImageBase::get_batch that gets a transparent batch from the vector of reusable batches,
 *  in order to avoid creating a new render batch.
 *  In the original code, this process merely involves checking if the vector was not empty, and if so pop_back the vector.
 *
 *  However this means that the code never checks if the Batch's vertex buffer is compatible with the current shader,
 *  leading to heap corruption if that happens to not be the case.
 *
 *  We override this behavior to instead search within the available transparent batches for the first one that has
 *  an element size equal to the vertex stride, and we swap it with the last one, leaving the rest to the original code.
 *  If we don't find one, we take the same code path that would have been taken if the vector was empty 
 *
 *  The swap is safe, as the order of the entries is not important.
 *  It is also safe for us to act as if the vector was empty, as the code path does not make assumption based on this fact.
